# fig 1
* include vertical line where liar fraction is greater or equal to m/n
* still include n=2 m=1, it's not being included right now

# fig 2
okay for now, try to see what trends exist? probably the model names need to be bigger

# fig 3
remove the liar calibration since it doesn't make sense to include

# fig 4
make sure blue is always on the left side (it's on the right side for some of subplots)

# fig 5
perhaps we should convert this to a table instead, would be easier to interpret, and we only care about the honest agents

# fig 6
fine to leave as is, probably we won't include in the main report

# fig 7
needs column labels, we should decide if we want to separate by model or not here as well

# fig 8
I think we can just remove this one

# fig 9
fine as is for now

# fig 10
double check code is doing the right thing, otherwise looks fine as is

# fig 11
removed

# fig 12 through 14
was trying to test the ablation conditions, but I think these need to be totally redone, they aren't very good right now
